# MOEX stock trading DSS.
* Stocker web2py app - archived. Poor performance on raspberry-pi.
* Future disign thoughts:
    - get pygal output graphs from db,
    - generate html reports from db,
    - redo in without db. ie get data from moex and process it to html,
    - experiment with https://plot.ly/dash. Appeart to be faster then web2py.
